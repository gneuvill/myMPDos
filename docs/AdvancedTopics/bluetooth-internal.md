## Enabling internal bluetooth

If bluetooth is disabled, enable it.

```sh
mount -oremount,rw /boot
sed -i 's/dtoverlay=disable-bt/#dtoverlay=disable-bt/' /boot/usercfg.txt
mount -oremount,ro /boot
savereboot.sh
```

The Bluetooth controller is not automatically discovered on the UART. Test attaching it and check that the controller is found.

```sh
btattach -B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm -S 115200 -N &
/etc/init.d/bluetooth start
```

After that `bluetoothctl list` should list your bluetooth controller.

If the interface is discovered after the attach, you can make attaching persistent by uncommenting the line next to "rpi bluetooth" in `/etc/mdev.conf`.

```sh
sed -i 's/^#ttyAMA0/ttyAMA0/' /etc/mdev.conf
```
